<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>
The purpuse of this repository its to show some planning algoritms to mapping a place and find a way out.
Markov decision processes are used in situations thatactions are pulled in sequence in environments with uncertainty. There are several problems that can be modeled by a Markov decision process,
such as the navigation system of a robot, which must decide to
where to move just by analyzing the impact sensors. However, it should
use certain algorithms to solve the MDP and find the best one
solution to the problem. This report contains the behavior of 3 algorithms, which are the most efficient and which parameters affect performance the most.
of the algorithm.
